## Well, hello there ðŸ‘‹

### Who am I?

I'm a tech enthusiast who would like to explore new technologies, not just programming languages but also devices.
I love to share knowledge with the rest of the world, and that's why I write a lot of articles, conduct courses, and make YouTube videos.
Since I'm (still) a full-time Software Engineer, I also like to share my code so others can make use of them.
